/**
 * This test class contains an improved version of a test originally generated by EvoSuite.
 * The original test had several understandability issues:
 * 1. A meaningless name "test30".
 * 2. Unused variables and incorrect static field access.
 * 3. A misleading call to `negated()` whose result was ignored, which is incorrect
 *    because the `Minutes` class is immutable.
 * This revised version addresses these points for clarity and correctness.
