        // Assert:  There are no explicit assertions in the original test, only exception handling.  This is common in automatically generated tests that focus on exception boundaries. The assertions are implicit by the lack of exceptions when *valid* operations occur and the presence of expected exceptions for *invalid* calls.  Explicit assertions could be added here if the expected behavior of the NullReader was more clearly defined for specific scenarios (e.g., the return value of `read()` after reaching the end of the stream).  Because the length is initialized to a negative number, we should generally expect `read()` methods to result in the stream being at the end or throwing exceptions.
